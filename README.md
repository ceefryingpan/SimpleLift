# SimpleLift
A basic workout app that I created. Starting junior year of high school I started to get into weightlifting and I needed something to track my progress - many people I saw carried around a worksheet and a pencil, but I thought that was inefficient and wanted something that I could just manage electronically. After being unsatisfied with what I found in the App Store I wanted to create my own app that could easily track my workouts and also give me suggestions on new workout routines to try. Includes three features - generating a workout based on user preferences, recording a workout, and viewing previous stats from previous workouts.
